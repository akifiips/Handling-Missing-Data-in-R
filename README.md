# Missing Data Handling in R

This repository contains an R  project that demonstrates various techniques for handling missing data in R using the `birthwt` dataset from the `MASS` package. The aim of this project is to explore different strategies for imputing missing values and visualize their impact on the dataset.

## Introduction

Handling missing data is a crucial step in data preprocessing. This project explores different methods to address missing values, ranging from simple techniques like mean/median replacement to more sophisticated approaches like k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Multiple Imputation using the `mice` and `Amelia` packages.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the `birthwt` dataset from the `MASS` package, which contains data on birth weights and various risk factors associated with low birth weight. For demonstration purposes, we introduce missing values in the `bwt` (birthweight) column.

## Methods

This project covers the following steps:
1. Introducing missing values to the dataset.
2. Visualizing the missing data using the `VIM` package.
3. Implementing various imputation techniques to handle missing values.
4. Comparing the effectiveness of different imputation techniques using density plots.

## Packages Required

The following R packages are required for this project:
- `MASS`
- `dplyr`
- `VIM`
- `mice`
- `Amelia`

To install the necessary packages, run:

```r
install.packages(c("MASS", "dplyr", "VIM", "mice", "Amelia"))
